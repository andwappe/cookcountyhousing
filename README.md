# Predicting Cook County Housing Prices

This is a data analysis of Cook County Housing prices. The goal of this projects was to build a model that could accurately assess the values of homes in Cook County. The dataset has 61 features in total; the 62nd is sales price, which is what we are trying to predict. 

This data analysis was created in a Jupyter Notebook. I used the packages pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, and seaborn. 

This code is refactored and developed further on a class project I did in Principles and Techniques of Data Science.
